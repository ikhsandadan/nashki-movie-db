## Nashki Movie Database with Affinidi

[Nashki Movie DB](https://nashki-movie-db.vercel.app/)

For this bounty, I have developed a web application for a movies database. The movies data is retrieved from the [www.themoviedb.org](http://www.themoviedb.org/) API, while Affinidi is used for user information.

![home](https://github.com/ikhsandadan/nashki-movie-db/assets/116878888/0d8df05a-bdda-4f91-b8ed-689dec18da87)

I will explain the features implemented here according to their respective pages.

  **1. Home Page**
  
  On the home page, there are several features, including:
  

 - Big carousel
   
 In this section, I have implemented a carousel feature that displays trending movies from around the world. Users can navigate through the carousel by clicking on the dot pagination or the arrows on the right and left sides.
